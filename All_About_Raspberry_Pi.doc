      *A. INTRODUCTION*


        *1. WHAT IS A RASPBERRY PI?*

The Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer that plugs into your TV
and a keyboard. It is a capable little computer which can be used in
electronics projects, and for many of the things that your desktop PC
does, like spreadsheets, word processing, browsing the internet, and
playing games. It also plays high-definition video. We want to see it
being used by kids all over the world to learn programming. You can read
more about the Raspberry Pi here
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-is-a-raspberry-pi/>.
-Introduction <#topIntro> -Top <#topToc>



        *2. CAN I BUY SHARES IN THE RASPBERRY PI FOUNDATION?*

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a charity, so you can’t buy shares in the
company. If you want to support us, we would love you to buy a Raspberry
Pi. -Introduction <#topIntro> -Top <#topToc>


      *B. BUYING AND SHIPPING*


        *1. WHERE CAN I BUY A RASPBERRY PI?*

You can buy a Raspberry Pi from our main distributors, Premier
Farnell/Element14
<http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi>and RS
Components/Allied Electronics
<http://uk.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=raspberrypi>. Both
distributors sell all over the world. There are also many resellers of
Raspberry Pis, both online and in bricks-and-mortar stores. -Buying and
Shipping <#topBuying> -Top <#topToc>


        *2. HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?*

The Model A+ costs $20, the Model B+ costs $25, the Pi 2 costs $35, the
Pi 3 costs $35, and the Pi Zero costs $5, plus local taxes and
shipping/handling fees. -Buying and Shipping <#topBuying> -Top <#topToc>


        *3. WHAT DO I GET WHEN I BUY ONE?*

You get the Raspberry Pi board itself. A power supply and SD card are
not included, but can be purchased at the same time from most places
that sell the Raspberry Pi. You can also purchase pre-loaded SD cards
<https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/noobs-8gb-sd-card> too; we recommend
buying these from us or our licensed distributors rather than from third
parties on eBay, as the software is being updated all the time and cards
sold by third parties can quickly become outdated. -Buying and Shipping
<#topBuying> -Top <#topToc>


        *4. WHY IS THE PRICE IN US DOLLARS? YOU ARE A UK COMPANY!*

The components we buy are priced in dollars, and we negotiate
manufacturing in dollars. Because currency markets are so volatile, we
price the final board in dollars too so we don’t have to keep changing
the price. -Buying and Shipping <#topBuying> -Top <#topToc>


        *5. IS THERE A BUY-ONE-GIVE-ONE PROGRAM?*

Not at the current time. We may implement a program of this sort one
day, but we’ve come to appreciate that the scale of a program like this
may be something our small team isn’t equipped to handle without taking
on extra staff. You can, of course, just buy an extra Pi to donate to
the person or organisation of your choice. -Buying and Shipping
<#topBuying> -Top <#topToc>


        *6. IS THE DEVICE AVAILABLE INTERNATIONALLY?*

Yes. -Buying and Shipping <#topBuying> -Top <#topToc>


        *7. I WANT TO BE A RASPBERRY PI RESELLER.*

We have an exclusive manufacturing and distribution arrangement with RS
and Farnell. Resellers buy the Raspberry Pi in bulk from them (which
reduces shipping costs to nearly nothing) and sell on. You do not need
any special license to resell, and the distributors are very happy to
sell on to resellers. Unfortunately, because of the way the pricing
model works, and the fact that we are a charity, you will have to buy in
very large quantities before you will qualify for any bulk discount;
what most resellers are doing is using the resale process as a way to
sell high-margin peripherals and so on. -Buying and Shipping
<#topBuying> -Top <#topToc>


      *C. GENERAL*


        *1. WHAT IS THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD FOR THE RASPBERRY PI?*

The default username for Raspbian is “pi” (without any quotation marks)
and the default password is “raspberry” (again, do not include the
quotation marks). If this does not work, check the information about
your specific distro on the downloads page
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads>. -General <#topGeneral> -Top
<#topToc>


        *2. WHY DOES NOTHING HAPPEN WHEN I TYPE IN MY PASSWORD? DID MY
        RASPBERRY PI FREEZE?*

To protect your information, Linux does not display anything when typing
in passwords in the Bash prompt or the terminal. As long as you were
able to see the username being typed in, your keyboard is working
correctly. -General <#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *3. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MODELS?*

These are the current models of the Raspberry Pi available: the Pi 2
Model B, the Pi 3 Model B, the Pi Zero, and the Pi 1 Model B+ and A+.

The Model A+ is the low-cost variant of the Raspberry Pi. It has 256MB
RAM, one USB port, 40 GPIO pins and no Ethernet port. The Model B+ is
the final revision of the original Raspberry Pi. It has 512MB RAM (twice
as much as the A+), four USB ports, 40 GPIO pins, and an Ethernet port.
In February 2015, it was superseded by the Pi 2 Model B, the second
generation of the Raspberry Pi. The Pi 2 shares many specs with the Pi 1
B+, but it uses a 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU and has 1GB RAM.
The Pi 2 is completely compatible with first generation boards, and is
the model we recommend for use in schools, due to its flexibility for
the learner. The Pi 3 Model B was launched in February 2016; it uses
a 1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU, has 1GB RAM, integrated
802.11n wireless LAN, and Bluetooth 4.1. Finally, the Pi Zero is half
the size of a Model A+, with a 1Ghz single-core CPU and 512MB RAM, and
mini-HDMI and USB On-The-Go ports.

 

You can check our products <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/> pages
for more details on current boards. There are also some models of
Raspberry Pi which are no longer in production, but which may be
available second-hand or from resellers. The Model A was the initial
low-cost variant of the Pi. It was replaced by the smaller, neater Model
A+ in November 2014; it shares the same specs as the A+, but has only 26
GPIO pins. The Model B was the previous incarnation of the B+; again, it
shares most of the same specs, but has only 2 USB ports and 26 GPIO
pins. -General <#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *4. HOW DO I CONNECT A MOUSE AND KEYBOARD?*

The Model A/A+ has one USB port, the Model B has two ports, and the
Model B+, 2B and 3B have four ports. These can be used to connect most
USB 2.0 devices. Additional USB devices such as mice, keyboards, network
adapters and external storage can be connected via a USB hub. -General
<#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *5. WHERE IS THE ON/OFF SWITCH?*

There is no on/off switch! To switch on, just plug it in. To switch off,
if you are in the graphical environment, first exit to the Bash prompt
or open the terminal. From the Bash prompt or terminal you can shut down
the Raspberry Pi by entering “sudo halt -h” (without the quotation
marks). Wait until all the LEDs except the power LED are off, then wait
an additional second to make sure the SD card can finish its wear
levelling tasks and write actions. You can now safely unplug the
Raspberry Pi. Failure to properly shut down the Raspberry Pi may corrupt
your SD card, which would mean you would have to re-image it. -General
<#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *6. WHO OR WHAT IS NOOBS?*

NOOBS stands for New Out of Box Software. It is our recommended
installation method. It allows you to install the distro of your choice,
even if you have little to no computing or Linux experience. You can
learn more about NOOBS here.
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/> -General <#topGeneral>
-Top <#topToc>


        *7. WHEN WILL THE NEXT MODEL OF THE RASPBERRY PI BE RELEASED?*

As of February 2016, the third generation of the Model B Raspberry Pi
has been released. Beyond this revision, which upgraded the main
processor on the board to a 64-bit version, there are no immediate plans
to release any more new models. We concentrate our engineering effort on
making the software that runs on the Raspberry Pi faster and better all
the time, which is why you should always ensure that you are running the
most recent firmware. -General <#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *8. WHAT ARE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE RASPBERRY PI?*

The Raspberry Pi measures 85.60mm x 56mm x 21mm (or roughly 3.37″ x
2.21″ x 0.83″), with a little overlap for the SD card and connectors
which project over the edges. It weighs 45g. The Pi Zero measures 65mm x
30mm x 5.4mm (or roughly 2.56″ x 1.18″ x 0.20″). For the mechanical
outline, please see the documentation here
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/mechanical/README.md>. -General
<#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *9. WHAT HARDWARE DOCUMENTATION IS AVAILABLE?*

All available documentation is in our documentation repository
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/>. -General <#topGeneral>
-Top <#topToc>


        *10. WHAT SoC ARE YOU USING?*

All versions and revisions of the Raspberry Pi other than the Raspberry
Pi 2B/3B use the Broadcom BCM2835. This contains an ARM1176JZFS with
floating point, running at 700Mhz, and a Videocore 4 GPU. The GPU is
capable of Blu-Ray-quality playback, using H.264 at 40MBits/s. It has a
fast 3D core, accessed using the supplied OpenGL ES2.0 and OpenVG
libraries. The Model 2B uses the Broadcom BCM2836. This contains a
quad-core ARM Cortex-a7 processor with floating point and NEON, running
at 900MHz, and the same Videocore 4 GPU that is in the other models of
Raspberry Pi. The Model 3B uses the Broadcom BCM2837, containing a
quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 running at 1.2GHz. Its GPU capabilities are
equivalent to the Pi 2. -General <#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *11. WHAT IS AN SoC?*

A System on a Chip (SoC) is a method of placing all necessary
electronics for running a computer on a single chip. Instead of having
an individual chip for the CPU, GPU, USB controller, RAM, northbridge,
southbridge, and so on, everything is compressed down into one tidy
package. -General <#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *12. WHY DID YOU SELECT THE ARM1176JZFS?*

Cost and performance. -General <#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *13. HOW DOES IT BOOT?*

All the files necessary for booting are installed in a FAT32 partition
of the SD card. The Raspberry Pi has to have an SD card installed to
boot from, but a USB HD can “take over” after the initial boot. You
cannot boot without an SD card. -General <#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


        *14. DO YOU SELL A SELF-ASSEMBLY KIT?*

No. It would be too expensive for us to provide kits alongside finished
boards, which would mean introducing another step in manufacturing. A
kit would also be impossible to hand-solder. We use special equipment
(robots!) to solder on the BGA package and other tiny components.
-General <#topGeneral> -Top <#topToc>


      *D. PERFORMANCE AND COST CONSIDERATIONS*


        *1. HOW POWERFUL IS IT?*

The GPU provides OpenGL ES 2.0, hardware-accelerated OpenVG, and 1080p30
H.264 high-profile encode and decode. The GPU is capable of 1Gpixel/s,
1.5Gtexel/s or 24 GFLOPs of general purpose compute and features a bunch
of texture filtering and DMA infrastructure. This means that graphics
capabilities are roughly equivalent to the original Xbox’s level of
performance. Overall real world performance for models A, A+, B & B+ is
something like a 300MHz Pentium 2, only with much better graphics. The
Model 2B is approximately equivalent to an Athlon Thunderbird running at
1.1GHz: again, it has the much higher-quality graphics that come from
using the same GPU as in previous models. The Model 3B is around 50%
faster than the 2B. -Performance and Cost Considerations <#topCost> -Top
<#topToc>


        *2. DOES IT OVERCLOCK?*

The Raspberry Pi models A, A+, B, and B+ operate at 700 MHz by default.
Most devices will run happily at 800MHz. The model 2B operates at 900MHz
by default and should run quite happily at 1000MHz. In the latest
Raspbian distro, there is an option to change the overclocking options
on first boot and at any time afterwards, without voiding your warranty,
by running “sudo raspi-config”. You can download the Raspbian image
directly or install it via the NOOBS installer, both available on our
downloads page. <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/>It should be
noted, however, that these are experimental settings and that not every
board will be able to run stably at the highest setting. If you
experience problems, try reducing the overclocking settings until
stability is restored. -Performance and Cost Considerations <#topCost>
-Top <#topToc>


        *3. DOES IT NEED A HEATSINK?*

You should not need to use a heatsink, as the chip used in the Raspberry
Pi is equivalent to that used in a mobile phone, and should not become
hot enough to need any special cooling. However, depending on the case
you are using and the overclocking settings, you might find a heatsink
to be advantageous. We recommend the use of a heatsink if overclocking
the Model 3B. Of course, if you just like the look of one, you will not
hurt the Raspberry Pi by placing an appropriately-sized heatsink on it.
-Performance and Cost Considerations <#topCost> -Top <#topToc>


        *4. WHAT HARDWARE INTERFACES DOES IT HAVE?*

Depending on the model, the Raspberry Pi has either 40 or 26 dedicated
GPIO pins. In all cases, these include a UART, an I2C bus, a SPI bus
with two chip selects, I2S audio, 3V3, 5V, and ground. The maximum
number of GPIOs can theoretically be indefinitely expanded by making use
of the I2C or SPI bus. -Performance and Cost Considerations <#topCost>
-Top <#topToc>


        *5. WHY IS THERE NO REAL-TIME CLOCK (RTC)?*

The expectation is that non-network-connected units will have their
clocks updated manually at startup. Adding an RTC is surprisingly
expensive once you have factored in batteries, area and components, and
would have pushed us above our target price. You can add one yourself
using the GPIO pins if you’d like an interesting electronics project.
-Performance and Cost Considerations <#topCost> -Top <#topToc>


        *6. CAN I ADD EXTRA MEMORY?*

No. The RAM on the model A, A+, B, B+, and Zero is a Package on Package
(POP) on top of the SoC, so it is not removable or swappable. The RAM on
the Model 2B/3B is on a separate chip on the bottom of the PCB, but 1GB
is the maximum RAM that the SoC used by the Model 2B can support.
-Performance and Cost Considerations <#topCost> -Top <#topToc>


        *7. WHY DOESN’T THE RASPBERRY PI INCLUDE <INSERT NAME> PIECE OF
        HARDWARE OR <INSERT NAME> SORT OF PORT?*

Our main aim is a charitable one: we are trying to build the cheapest
possible computer that provides a certain basic level of functionality,
and keeping the price low means we’ve had to make hard decisions about
what hardware and interfaces to include. -Performance and Cost
Considerations <#topCost> -Top <#topToc>


        *8. What is its operating temperature?*

The Raspberry Pi is built from commercial chips which are qualified to
different temperature ranges; the LAN9512 is specified by the
manufacturers as being qualified from 0°C to 70°C, while the AP is
qualified from -40°C to 85°C. You may well find that the board will work
outside those temperatures, but we’re not qualifying the board itself to
these extremes. -Performance and Cost Considerations <#topCost> -Top
<#topToc>


        *9. DOES IT BLEND?*

Yes. We have conducted extensive virtual simulations. No Raspberry Pis
were harmed in the testing process. -Performance and Cost Considerations
<#topCost> -Top <#topToc>


      *E. CAMERA*


        *1. WHAT IS THE CAMERA BOARD?*

The camera board is a small PCB that connects to the CSI-2 camera port
on the Raspberry Pi using a short ribbon cable. It provides connectivity
for a camera capable of capturing still images or video recordings. The
camera connects to the Image System Pipeline (ISP) in the Raspberry Pi’s
SoC, where the incoming camera data is processed and eventually
converted to an image or video on the SD card (or other storage). You
can read more about the camera board here
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/>. -Camera <#topCamera> -Top <#topToc>


        *2. WHAT MODEL OF CAMERA DOES THE CAMERA BOARD USE?*

The camera module V2 is a Sony IMX219, while the original camera module
is an Omnivision 5647. They are comparable to cameras used in mobile
phones. -Camera <#topCamera> -Top <#topToc>


        *3. WHAT RESOLUTIONS ARE SUPPORTED?*

The camera module V2 is capable of taking photos up to 8 megapixels
(8MP). It supports 1080p30, 720p60 and VGA90 video modes, as well as
still capture. The original camera module is capable of taking photos up
to 5 megapixels and can record video at resolutions up to 1080p30.
-Camera <#topCamera> -Top <#topToc>


        *4. WHICH PICTURE FORMATS ARE SUPPORTED?*

The camera module supports raw capturing (Bayer data direct from the
sensor) or encoding as JPEG, PNG, GIF and BMP, uncompressed YUV, and
uncompressed RGB photos. It can record video as H.264, baseline,
main and high-profile formats. -Camera <#topCamera> -Top <#topToc>


        *5. HOW DO I USE THE CAMERA?*

There are three command line applications provided for stills, video,
and stills output uncompressed. These applications provide the typical
features you might find on a compact cameras, such as set image size,
compression quality, exposure mode, and ISO. See the documentation
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/camera.md> for more
details. -Camera <#topCamera> -Top <#topToc>


        *6. CAN I EXTEND THE RIBBON CABLE?*

Yes. We have reports of people using cables up to 4 metres and still
receiving acceptable images, though your experience may differ. -Camera
<#topCamera> -Top <#topToc>


        *7. CAN I HAVE A CAMERA WITH MORE MEGAPIXELS?*

No; this is the only camera module that is compatible with the Raspberry
Pi. There are currently no plans to release a higher-resolution sensor.
-Camera <#topCamera> -Top <#topToc>


        *8. HOW MUCH POWER DOES THE CAMERA MODULE USE?*

The camera board requires 250mA to operate. Ensure that your power
supply can provide enough power for the camera module, as well as the
Raspberry Pi and any peripherals directly attached to the Raspberry Pi.
-Camera <#topCamera> -Top <#topToc>


      *F. CASES*


        *1. DOES IT COME WITH A CASE?*

An official case for the Raspberry Pi is available from our Store
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-case/>. There are
also lots of homebrew case discussions on the forum, as well as several
third-party cases available. We suggest stopping by the cases sub-forum
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=40> and reading some
of the threads about cases you can purchase or build yourself. -Cases
<#topCases> -Top <#topToc>


        *2. DOES IT FIT IN AN ALTOIDS TIN?*

It is possible to make a case for the Raspberry Pi out of an Altoids
tin: there are instructions given in a forum post here
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=28814> (the
directions are also available as an Instructables guide
<http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Case-From-an-Altoids-Ti/>).
However, you may find that this is not possible with older boards, as
their form factors are not as neat. You can, of course, fit a Pi Zero
into an Altoids tin with room to spare. -Cases <#topCases> -Top <#topToc>


      *G. VIDEO*


        *1. WHAT DISPLAYS CAN I USE?*

There is composite and HDMI out on the board, so you can hook it up to
an old analogue TV through the composite or through a composite to scart
connector, to a digital TV or to a DVI monitor (using a cheap, passive
HDMI->DVI cable for the DVI). For the Model B+, 2B and 3B, the RCA
composite jack has been replaced with a 3.5mm jack that combines audio
and video in one. You’ll need a 3.5mm to 3RCA adapter cable to connect
it to an older TV. There are many different types of this cable out
there, but you want to purchase on that is compatible with the iPod
Video (the iPod will have the left and right audio channels reversed,
but the version of Raspbian included with NOOBS can swap this for you).
The Pi Zero uses a mini-HDMI port.

There is no VGA support, but active adapters are available. Passive
HDMI->VGA cables will not work with the Raspberry Pi. When purchasing an
active VGA adapter, make sure it comes with an external power supply.
HDMI->VGA adapters without an external power supply often fail to work.
-Video <#topVideo> -Top <#topToc>


        *2. DOES THE HDMI PORT SUPPORT CEC?*

Yes, the HDMI port on the Raspberry Pi supports the CEC Standard. CEC
may be called something else by your TV’s manufacturer; check the
Wikipedia entry on CEC
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control#CEC> for more
information. -Video <#topVideo> -Top <#topToc>


        *3. WHY IS THERE NO VGA SUPPORT?*

The chip we use supports HDMI and composite outputs but does not support
VGA. VGA is considered to be an end-of-life technology, so supporting it
doesn’t fit with our plans at the moment. However, if you really want to
use a VGA monitor with a Raspberry Pi then it is possible  using an
HDMI->VGA adapter or Gert Van Loo’s VGA666 adapter. -Video <#topVideo>
-Top <#topToc>


        *4. CAN I ADD A TOUCHSCREEN?*

The Foundation provides a 7″ capacitive touchscreen that utilises the
Pi’s DSI port, which is available through the usual distributors.
Alternatively, several third-party retailers offer a range of
touchscreens for the Raspberry Pi. -Video <#topVideo> -Top <#topToc>


        *5. WHAT CODECS CAN IT PLAY?*

The Raspberry Pi can encode (record) and decode (play) H.264 (MP4/MKV)

        *1. IS SOUND OVER HDMI SUPPORTED?*

Yes. -Audio <#topAudio> -Top <#topToc>


        *2. WHAT ABOUT STANDARD AUDIO IN AND OUT?*

There is a standard 3.5mm jack for audio out to an amplifier. You can
add any supported USB microphone for audio in or, using the I2S
interface, you can add a codec for additional audio I/O. -Audio

      *I. POWER*


        *1. WHAT ARE THE POWER REQUIREMENTS?*

The device is powered by 5V micro-USB. Exactly how much current (mA) the
Raspberry Pi requires is dependent on what you hook up to it. We have
found that purchasing a 1.2A (1200mA) power supply from a reputable
retailer will provide you with ample power to run your Raspberry Pi for
most applications, though you may want to get a 2.5A (2500mA) power
supply if you want to use all 4 USB ports on the Models B+/2B/3B without
using an external powered USB hub. The table below outlines the power
requirements of each model.

Product 	Recommended PSU current capacity 	Maximum total USB peripheral
current draw 	Typical bare-board active current consumption
Raspberry Pi Model A 	700mA 	500mA 	200mA
Raspberry Pi Model B 	1.2A 	500mA 	500mA
Raspberry Pi Model A+ 	700mA 	500mA 	180mA
Raspberry Pi Model B+ 	1.8A 	600mA/1.2A (switchable) 	330mA
Raspberry Pi 2 Model B 	1.8A 	600mA/1.2A (switchable) 	
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B 	2.5A 	1.2A 	~400mA

The specific current requirements of each model are dependent on the use
case: the PSU recommendations are based on “typical maximum” current
consumption, the typical current consumption is for each board in a
“desktop computer” configuration. The Raspberry Pi model A, A+, and B
can supply a maximum of 500mA to downstream USB peripherals. If you wish
to connect a high-power USB device then it is recommended to connect a
powered USB hub to the Pi and connect your peripherals to the USB hub.
The Raspberry Pi model B+ and 2B can supply 600mA/1.2A to downstream USB
peripherals, switchable by a firmware setting. This allows the vast
majority of USB devices to be connected directly to these models,
assuming the upstream power supply has sufficient available current.
Very high-current devices or devices can draw a surge current such as
certain 3G modems and USB hard disks will still require an external
powered USB hub. The power requirements of the Raspberry Pi increase as
you make use of the various interfaces on the Raspberry Pi. The GPIO
pins can draw 50mA safely (that is 50mA distributed across all the pins!
An individual GPIO pin can only safely draw 16mA), the HDMI port uses
50mA, the camera module requires 250mA, and keyboards and mice can take
as little as 100mA or as much as 1000mA! Check the power rating of the
devices you plan to connect to the Pi and purchase a power supply
accordingly. If you’re not sure, we would advise you to buy a powered hub.

Here is a table comparing the amount of power drawn in amps under
different situations:

* * 	* * 	*Pi1 (B+)* 	*Pi2 B* 	*Pi3 B (Amps)* 	*Zero (Amps)*
Boot 	Max 	0.26 	0.40 	0.75 	0.20
	Avg 	0.22 	0.22 	0.35 	0.15
Idle 	Avg 	0.20 	0.22 	0.30 	0.10
Video playback (H.264) 	Max 	0.30 	0.36 	0.55 	0.23
	Avg 	0.22 	0.28 	0.33 	0.16
Stress 	Max 	0.35 	0.82 	1.34 	0.35
	Avg 	0.32 	0.75 	0.85 	0.23

Test conditions used a standard Raspbian image (current as of 26 Feb
2016), at room temperature, connected to a HDMI monitor, USB keyboard
and mouse. For the Model 3B it was connected to a WiFi access point. All
these power measurements do not take into account power consumption from
additional USB devices; these measurements can easily be exceeded with
multiple additional USB devices connected or using a HAT.

        *2. CAN I POWER THE RASPBERRY PI FROM A USB HUB?*

It depends on the hub. Some hubs comply with the USB 2.0 Standard and
only provide 500mA per port, which may not be enough to power your
Raspberry Pi. Other hubs view the USB standards more like guidelines,
and will provide as much power as you want from each port. Please also
be aware that some hubs have been known to “backfeed” the Raspberry Pi.
This means that the hubs will power the Raspberry Pi through its USB
input cable, without the need for a separate micro-USB power cable, and
bypass the voltage protection. If you are using a hub that “backfeeds”
to the Raspberry Pi and the hub experiences a power surge, your
Raspberry Pi could potentially be damaged. -Power <#topPower> -Top <#topToc>


        *3. CAN I POWER THE RASPBERRY PI FROM BATTERIES AS WELL AS FROM
        A WALL SOCKET?*

Running the Raspberry Pi directly from batteries requires special care
and can result in damaging or destroying your Raspberry Pi. If you
consider yourself an advanced user, though, you could have a go. For
example, 4xAA rechargeable batteries would provide 4.8V on a full
charge. 4.8V would technically be just within the range of tolerance for
the Raspberry Pi, but the system would quickly become unstable as the
batteries lost their full charge. Conversely, using 4xAA Alkaline
(non-rechargeable) batteries will result in 6V. 6V is outside the
acceptable tolerance range and would potentially damage or, in the worst
case scenario, destroy your Raspberry Pi. It is possible to provide a
steady 5V from batteries by using a buck and/or boost circuit, or by
using a charger pack which is specifically designed to output a steady
5V from a couple of batteries; these devices are typically marketed
as mobile phone emergency battery chargers. -Power <#topPower> -Top
<#topToc>


        *4. IS POWER OVER ETHERNET (PoE) POSSIBLE?*

Not in the base device. There are adapters that would split the voltage
off the Ethernet line before connecting to the Pi, but they are
relatively expensive. -Power <#topPower> -Top <#topToc>


      *J. SOFTWARE*


        *1. WHAT OPERATING SYSTEM (OS) DOES IT USE?*

There are several official distributions (distros) available on our
downloads <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads> page. New users will
probably find the NOOBS installer the easiest to work with, as it walks
you through the download and installation of a specific distro. The
recommended distro is Raspbian, which is specifically designed for the
Raspberry Pi and which our engineers are constantly optimising. It is,
however, a straightforward process to replace the root partition on the
SD card with another ARM Linux distro, so we encourage you to try out
several distros to see which one you like the most. The OS is stored on
the SD card. -Software <#topSoftware> -Top <#topToc>


        *2. DOES IT HAVE AN OFFICIAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE?*

The Raspberry Pi Foundation recommends Python as a language for
learners. We also recommend Scratch for younger kids. Any language which
will compile for ARMv6 (Pi 1) or ARMv7 (Pi 2) can be used with the
Raspberry Pi, though, so you are not limited to using Python. C, C++,
Java, Scratch, and Ruby all come installed by default on the Raspberry
Pi. -Software <#topSoftware> -Top <#topToc>


        *3. WILL IT RUN WINE (OR WINDOWS, OR OTHER X86 SOFTWARE)?*

In general, this is not possible with most versions of the Raspberry Pi.
Some people have put Windows 3.1 on the Raspberry Pi inside an x86 CPU
emulator in order to use specific applications, but trying to use a
version of Windows even as recent as Windows 98 can take hours to boot
into, and may take several more hours to update your cursor every time
you try to move it. We don’t recommend it! As of summer 2015, a version
of Windows 10 is available for use on the Raspberry Pi 2. This is an
entirely new version of the operating system designed exclusively for
embedded use, dubbed the Windows 10 Internet of Things (IoT) Core. It
does not include the user interface (“shell”) or the desktop operating
system.   -Software <#topSoftware> -Top <#topToc>


        *4. WILL IT RUN THE WINDOWS 8 ARM EDITION?*

No. Even if Microsoft decided to devote all its resources to getting
Windows 8 on the Pi it would not work. The Raspberry Pi lacks the
minimum memory and CPU requirements, it runs on a version of the ARM
processor that is not supported by Windows 8, it lacks the appropriate
axis sensors, and there are many other limiting factors. The Pi will not
run Windows 8. -Software <#topSoftware> -Top <#topToc>


        *5. WHAT LINUX DISTROS RUN ON THE PI?*

Raspbian (based on Debian), Arch Linux and Pidora run on Raspberry Pi 1
and 2. Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Snappy Core also run on Pi 2 only. See our
downloads page <https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/> for more
information. -Software <#topSoftware> -Top <#topToc>


        *6. WILL IT RUN ANDROID?*

No. While a version of Android can be found in the forum, it is not
stable enough for everyday use. There are no plans to continue working
on it, as Android does not provide any enhancement to educational
purposes that are not already fulfilled more readily with existing
software – we see it as a platform for consumption, not creation.
-Software <#topSoftware> -Top <#topToc>


        *7. WILL IT RUN <INSERT NAME OF PROGRAM HERE>*

In general, you need to look to see whether the program you want can be
compiled for the ARMv6 (Pi 1) or ARMv7 (Pi 2) architecture. In most
cases, the answer will be yes. Specific programs are discussed on our
forum, so you might want to look there for an answer. Ultimately,
nothing beats grabbing a Raspberry Pi and finding out the answer through
direct testing! -Software <#topSoftware> -Top <#topToc>


      *K. SD CARDS AND STORAGE*


        *1. WHAT SIZE SD CARD DO I NEED?*

Whether you want to use the NOOBS installer or a standalone distro
image, the minimum size SD card we recommend using is 8GB. This will
give you the free space you need to install additional packages or make
programs of your own. The original Raspberry Pi Model A
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a/> and Raspberry Pi Model B
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/> require full-size SD
cards. The newer Raspberry Pi Model A+
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-a-plus/>, Raspberry Pi Model
B+ <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/>, Raspberry Pi 2
Model B <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/>,
Raspberry Pi Zero <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/>, and
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/> require
micro SD cards. -SD Cards and Storage <#topSdCards> -Top <#topToc>


        *2. WHAT SIZE SD CARD CAN IT SUPPORT?*

We have tried cards up to 32GB, and most cards seem to work OK. You can
also attach a USB stick or USB hard drive to provide extra storage. -SD
Cards and Storage <#topSdCards> -Top <#topToc>


        *3. WHAT HAPPENS IF I BRICK THE DEVICE?*

You can restore the device by reflashing the SD card. -SD Cards and
Storage <#topSdCards> -Top <#topToc>


      *L. NETWORKING, USB AND WIRELESS*


        *1. DOES THE DEVICE SUPPORT NETWORKING?*

The Model B, Model B+ and Model 2B/3B versions of the device have built
in 10/100 wired Ethernet. There is no Ethernet on the Model A,  Model
A+, and Zero versions. -Networking, USB, and Wireless <#topNetworking>
-Top <#topToc>


        *2. IS THERE BUILT-IN WIFI?*

Only the Pi 3 has built in WiFi, but all other models can support a USB
WiFi dongle. The Foundation offers its own branded WiFi dongle which has
been fully tested for use with the Raspberry Pi. It is available through
our Swag store <http://swag.raspberrypi.org/>. You can, of course, use a
dongle from another provider if you wish. -Networking, USB, and Wireless
<#topNetworking> -Top <#topToc>


        *3. IS THERE BUILT-IN BLUETOOTH?*

Only on the Pi 3. -Networking, USB, and Wireless <#topNetworking> -Top
<#topToc>


        *4. WHY IS THERE NO GIGABIT ETHERNET?*

The Ethernet is attached via the USB 2.0 bus, so the upstream bandwidth
would not support Gigabit. -Networking, USB, and Wireless
<#topNetworking> -Top <#topToc>


        *5. DOES THE DEVICE HAVE SUPPORT FOR ANY FORM OF NETBOOTING OR PXE?*

The Raspberry Pi does not support PXE booting or network booting without
an SD card. If you want to network boot multiple Raspberry Pis, you
could use PiNet <http://pinet.org.uk/>. This is a free and open-source
community-based project initially designed for schools. Each Raspberry
Pi boots off a small set of startup files on an SD card and fetches the
rest of the data it needs from the PiNet server, thereby allowing you to
maintain a single operating system image for all the Raspberry Pis.
PiNet also adds network user accounts, shared folders and automated
backups. -Networking, USB, and Wireless <#topNetworking> -Top <#topToc>


        *6. HOW DO YOU CONNECT MORE USB DEVICES?*

Use a USB hub to increase the number of ports. Some keyboards have USB
hubs built in which would work well. It is highly recommended that you
use a powered USB hub. -Networking, USB, and Wireless <#topNetworking>

      *M. EDUCATIONAL USES*


        *1. WHAT EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE?*

There are many books about the Raspberry Pi available. For children, we
particularly recommend Adventures in Raspberry Pi
<https://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/5329> by Carrie Anne Philbin, who
works with us at the Foundation. Check out our resources pages for free
educational materials <https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/>: we are
always adding to these. You’ll find complete schemes of work linked to
the England, Wales and NI curriculum, as well as resources for
independent and informal learning. -Educational Uses <#topEducation>
